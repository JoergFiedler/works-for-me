## How to add my setup?

-- Programming

My laptop is MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM.

> iTerm 2 (https://www.iterm2.com/), tmux (https://tmux.github.io/)

> Docker

All software with more or less heavy dependence goes into containers to not pollute the system...

You can leave a comment inside setup.
```
// Add some description...
```

Such line won't be rendered.

## What goes to RSS-feed

RSS-feed is based on commit-messages.

If you are about to commit new setup start commit-message with `new: `

```
new: John Doe (Software Engineer)
```

You can add a few words about you, commit-message goes to the feed.

For major updates to existing setup, use `update: `, that also goes to RSS.

```
update: Changed IDE
```

If you want to fix some typos or make minor chages, use `fix: `, no-one will see that one.

```
fix: Fixing typos
```
